Sell astrology birth reports with WooCommerce.

== Description ==

ZodiacPress For WooCommerce lets you sell astrology birth reports in your WooCommerce store. This plugin is an extension for both [ZodiacPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zodiacpress/) and [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), so you must have those two plugins activated in order to use this plugin.

Without this plugin, ZodiacPress lets your visitors create birth reports on your site. With this plugin, you'll be able to put a price on the report. Then, your visitors will have to pay to view the report. They will be able to view the report immediately when they pay.

**Privacy Policy and EU GDPR Compliance**

"ZodiacPress For WooCommerce," being an extension for WooCommerce, saves information to the WooCommerce tables of your WordPress database. The information collected on the birth report form includes name, date of birth, time of birth, and place of birth (other types of astrology reports may request other information). This information will be stored with the customer's order. The information is then used to create the report for the customer.
