Sell astrology birth reports with WooCommerce.

== Description ==

ZodiacPress For WooCommerce lets you sell astrology birth reports in your WooCommerce store. This plugin is an extension for both [ZodiacPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zodiacpress/) and [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/), so you must have those two plugins activated in order to use this plugin.

Without this plugin, ZodiacPress lets your visitors create birth reports on your site. With this plugin, you'll be able to put a price on the report. Then, your visitors will have to pay to view the report. They will be able to view the report immediately when they pay.
